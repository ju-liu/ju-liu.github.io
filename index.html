    <p>I am Ju Liu. I currently work as a <span itemprop="title">postdoctoral
      researcher</span>
    at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu">Stanford university</a>. I obtained 
    my Ph.D. degree in computational sciences, engineering, and mathematics at 
    <a href="http://www.ices.utexas.edu">ICES</a>, <a
        href="http://www.utexas.edu">the University of Texas at Austin</a>.</p>
    
    <p> I have been working on continuum mechanics, numerical analysis, multiphase flow modeling, large-scale finite element programming, and CFD simulation. I have developed a parallel object-oriented nonlinear dynamic isogeometric analysis code based on C++. Recently, I have switched my research interests to cardiovascular biomechanics. I am trying to construct a computational model for the arterial growth in order to understand the causes of vein graft failure.</p>
   
    <p> I am currently on the job market. I am actively seeking for an assistant professor position in applied and computational mechanics.
