  <h2>What am I up to?</h2>
  <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~poulson/courses/MitRW15/">Teaching</a> in
  the Spring quarter just flew by. I've recently added support for distributed
  dense and sparse-direct Linear, Quadratic, and Second-Order Cone Programs into
  <a href="https://github.com/elemental/Elemental">Elemental</a> and begun
  integration into more user-friendly tools (e.g., <a
    href="https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy">CVXPY</a>). 
  The current Second-Order Cone solver should be reasonably efficient for 
  small second-order cones (e.g., those arising from 
  complex $ \ell_1 $ penalties),
  but efficient support for sparse SOC problems with large second-order cones
  is upcoming, and support for distributed sparse Interior Point Methods for 
  Semidefinite Programs is likely several months away.
