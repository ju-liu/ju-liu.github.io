<h2>Research Sampling</h2>
  <h3>Boiling</h3>
  <p>Boiling is a complex phase transition phenomenon. It involves complex fluid
  flows, various instability phenomena, and liquid-vapor phase change. We have
  developed a suite of novel theoretical and numerical methodologies for the
  study of boiling. The following figure shows a snapshot of the temperature
  field in a boiling simulation.</p>

  <h3>FDA benchmark</h3>
  <p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) introduces a set of benchmark
  problems for CFD code validation. The PERIGEE code has been tested at Reynolds
  number 500, 3500, and 5000 using a mesh of 28 million linear tetrahedral
  elements. The numerical results matches well with the experimental results.
  The following figure shows a snapshot of the flow field at Reynolds number 500
  (top), 3500 (middle), and 5000 (bottom).</p>

  <h3>Patient-specific cardiovascular simulations</h3>
  <p>This pulmonary model is built from a healthy 20 month old male, consisting of 772 outlets and 6 Strahler orders. The simulation is performed with a boundary layer mesh with 26 million linear elements. The model is prepared by Ms. M. Dong and the mesh is prepared by Dr. W. Yang from Stanford.</p>
