<div class="cv">
  <p>My research is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China,
  Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Joint Laboratory for Data-Driven Fluid Mechanics and
  Engineering Applications, and the Southern University of Science and
  Technology.</p>

<h2>Research Facilities</h2>
<p>My research group has access to the TianHe-2A cluster, located at the
National Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou, as well as the Tai-Yi supercomputer
on campus. Both are P-scale machines and support our computational investigation
of multi-physics and multi-scale problems.

My lab is equipped with ThinkStation P920/P620 tower workstations for methodology development.
